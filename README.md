# Zo's-CSS-Quick-Guide

## Description

My primary motivation for making this CSS Quick Guide was to make a fun and simple way of remembering CSS elements, functions, properties, etc. if I ever need an excellent CSS refresher!
This CSS Quick Guide will be a game changer in housing an easily accessible library of CSS knowledge that I fall back on in the future. 
By making this CSS Quick Guide, I was able to practice my CSS skills along the way, which is a massive bonus in retaining and remembering key elements when coding in CSS. 

## Usage

As easy as copying and pasting the CSS snippets that you'll need!
